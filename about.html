    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p class="parag">I have a deep passion for <span>teaching</span> and sharing knowledge, and as a developer from Lebanon, I am fortunate to have the opportunity to contribute to the growth and learning of others. 
        I find great joy in<span>helping</span>individuals understand complex concepts and empowering them with the skills they need to succeed.
        Seeing the spark of <span>understanding</span> in someone's eyes is incredibly rewarding!
        In addition to my love for teaching, I prioritize spending quality time with my <span>friends</span>and<span>family</span>.
        Having a special affinity for kids, I thoroughly enjoy playing and interacting with them. 
        Their innocent and boundless energy never fails to bring a smile to my face. Witnessing their enthusiasm and curiosity is truly inspiring, and it reminds me of the importance of fostering a love for learning and exploration from a young age.
        As a developer, I am drawn to the world of <span>applications</span> and <span>projects</span>.
        Fishing and going on <span>adventures</span> allow me to disconnect from the digital world.
        Lastly, I have a passion for gaming.
        <span>Gaming</span>serves as a creative outlet that allows me to <span>explore</span>different worlds, connect with fellow gamers, and engage in captivating narratives.</p>
